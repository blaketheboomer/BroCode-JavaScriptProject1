<!-- Things learned as I was making this
 1. Elements in HTML that have no closing tag are called void elements
 2. The HTML tag serves a container for the document. This is the root element
 3. Script is placed at the end of the body as browsers load synchonsly, Also this messes up the DOM?
 4. The <meta> tag is a void element that provides metadata about the webpage
    4.1 UTF 8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8 bit) is a standard format that extends acceptable characters past the standard ASCII
    ... This is imporortant to ensure compliance with other webpages. See Wikipedia for further encoding info
5. The name attribute is kinda like a global varible for meta? It acts like this name = "" calls the varible name and contents feeds
... the value into name. So for something like viewport, we are saying the viewport is globally defined as  width=device-width, 
...... intial-scale = 1
6. link rel defines the relationship between the documents. Ex rel="stylesheet" lets the link element know that the following link 
... should be treated like as style sheet
