Lessons Learned:
1st. The document object has two methods(think like a function) The first method is the getElementById method. This method grabs 
... the element of the html document by its given ID AKA its goverment name. After this method is performed the element is returned
.... to be passed into the next method onClick. This method acts opon the element button to create and event upon this event. This
..... event is like a conditional whereas once the conditional is meet the funtion will execute.
2nd. Make sure things are spelled and sourced correctly
