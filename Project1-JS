Lessons Learned:
1st. The document object has two methods(think like a function) The first method is the getElementById method. This method grabs 
... the element of the html document by its given ID AKA its goverment name. After this method is performed the element is returned
.... to be passed into the next method onClick. This method acts opon the element button to create and event upon this event. This
..... event is like a conditional whereas once the conditional is meet the funtion will execute.
2nd. Make sure things are spelled and sourced correctly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After using brocodes method a couple things I observes
1st. be careful with auto syntax, sometimes it is mid lol
2nd. when assigning the const assign the target element and not the method/text value. This will not work if done in the wrong syntax
... also brocodes methos is morescable/readable than mine was. So keep that in mind
3rd. In the element you can set a default value IE 0 as the argument to currentNumber in the HTML fill and then override it with the
... java script textContenet. I personally on using brocodes method did not do this as i still feel like it is more appropriate to definr
....in the java script file.
